# Credit-Risk-Modelling-using-Python

Analyzed over 32,000 past loan applications to build a credit risk model that helps our lending team automatically identify high-risk applicants. For instance, borrowers with a high loan_percent_income and past default history were 4x more likely to default again. By integrating the model into our application process, we reduced risky approvals by 35%, saving â‚¹12 Cr in potential bad loans annually. This also helped free up our underwriters' time by over 50%, letting them focus on strategic approvals.
